                    <p> I worked for 
                        <a href="https://www.potomacelectric.com/" target="_blank">Potomac Electric Corporation</a>
                        as an Electronics Engineer where I was involved in the motor manufacturing industry 
                        and the production of control drives and power amplifiers starting from PCBs. I build h-bridge rectifiers used 
                        for three phase servo motors and power supplies with AC-DC and DC-DC converters using rectifiers and transformers. 
                        I got to work with linear encoders and built software for aligning motor resolvers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to that, I worked for
                        <a href="https://www.canvasgfx.com/" target="_blank">Canvas GFX</a> as a Systems Engineering Technical 
                        Support where I created 30+ video tutorials on how to use the Envision software. I worked with 3d cad models
                        in softwares such as SolidWorks and Fusion 360 to edit existing models and create new ones.

                    <p> My personal interests include arduino/raspbarry pi projects.
                        I play a lot of soccer and volleyball and I am a huge fan of swimming.
                        I recently found out I am also a huge fan of hiking. The biggest hike of mine yet has been 
                        Mount. Lafayette through the Falling Waters Trail that took 8 hrs to complete.
